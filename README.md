This reporstery includes my Java Projects during my bachelor degree education in Bahçeşehir University.

<b>Advanced Programming: Cannon Game </b>
The aim of this game is shutting Bushy, Crow and Devil which come to our caste from garden.
When canon's fire cross to creature its appearance returns to a ghost and with animation the ghost goes to up for a second and disappear.
All creatures have different points and affect our bullets differently.
Firstly, shutting a Crow is 6 points, Bushy is 10 points and Devil is 16 points. According to kind of creature, gamer wins extra bullet such as a bullet for Bushy and two bullets for Devil.
The second rule is dangerous area. If creature’s randomly circle route won’t be gamer’s castle (ıf it will go to empty air), gamer will not take any point despite s/he kill the creature.
After, entering username and press “start” button you can begin and you can stop whenever you want.
You will see the highest score & owner on the left and “max” txt file.
This game was implemented using by Java and its gui elements.


<b>Analysis of Algorithms: Maze Game </b>
I made a maze game by using dept first search algorithm which creates a maze to solve and solves the maze when user push "solve" button.

<b>Formal Languages and Automata Theory: String Matcher </b>
This project is about to the string matching problem. String matching is the problem of finding the number of occurrences of a pattern in a given text.
In this project two algorithms Finite Automation Matcher and Naive string matcher were implemented and the result was compered according to time.
